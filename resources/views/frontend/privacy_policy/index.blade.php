                <h3><strong>CROSS TUNES GLOBAL REFUND POLICY</strong></h3>
                <p>Hi, we&amp;#39;re Cross Tunes Global and welcome to the Cross Tunes Global Market Refund Rules. Because we are<br />a platform, these rules outline what you can expect from the authors of the items you buy.</p>
                <p><br />They apply to all authors and customers.<br />The products that Cross Tunes Global sell on the platform are digital goods and cannot be &amp;quot;returned&amp;quot;,<br />so your entitlement to a refund is designed with this in mind. Of course, in addition to these<br />rules, each country has its own laws surrounding refunds, and these local laws are not excluded<br />if they apply to you.</p>
                <h3><br /><strong>Before you ask for a refund from Cross Tunes Global</strong></h3>
                <h3><br /><strong>Item is not as described&nbsp;or the item doesn&rsquo;t work the way it</strong><br /><strong>should.</strong></h3>
                <p><br />If an item doesn&rsquo;t work the way it should then the author is required to promptly fix the issue<br />by updating the item. An item is &amp;quot;not as described&amp;quot; if it is materially different from the item<br />description or preview. If the issue can&rsquo;t be fixed or it turns out that the item is &ldquo;not as<br />described&rdquo; then you would be entitled to a refund from the Cross Tunes Global.</p>
                <h3><br />Item support is promised but not provided</h3>
                <p><br />If Cross Tunes Global advertises their item as including item support, you have a current support<br />entitlement, and you are not provided that support in accordance with the&nbsp;item support<br />policy&nbsp;the author should provide you with a refund.</p>
                <h3><br /><strong>Items that have not been downloaded</strong></h3>
                <p>If you have not downloaded a purchased item within 2 months from the date of purchase, you<br />may be eligible for a refund. You will be required to provide the Cross Tunes Global of that item your<br />purchase code in order for Cross Tunes Global to verify your claim that you have not downloaded an<br />item. Although we think 2 months is a reasonable time, depending on where you are located,<br />you might have a longer period to claim a refund if you have purchased for personal use and<br />haven&amp;#39;t downloaded the item.</p>
                <p><strong>Cross Tunes Global not obliged to give policy refunds in any of the situations</strong><br /><strong>listed below.</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>&nbsp;You don&amp;#39;t want it after you&nbsp;downloaded it</li>
                    <li>&nbsp;The item did not meet your expectations or you feel the item is of low quality</li>
                    <li>&nbsp;You simply change your mind</li>
                    <li>&nbsp;You bought an item by mistake</li>
                    <li>&nbsp;You do not have sufficient expertise to use the item</li>
                    <li>&nbsp;You claim that you are entitled to a refund but do not provide sufficient information as to why you are entitled to a refund</li>
                </ul>
